## Key Concepts

**Docusaurus** — The open-source documentation framework (by Meta) that powers every site you create with DocuSapiens. It converts Markdown files into a professional, searchable website.

**GitHub Sync** — DocuSapiens watches your GitHub repository. Every time you commit and push, your site automatically rebuilds with the latest content.

**AI Chat** — A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that reads your documentation and answers user questions. It never invents information — it only uses what's in your docs.

**Subdomain** — Your site is hosted at `<subdomain>.docusapiens.ai`. You choose the subdomain when you create your site.
